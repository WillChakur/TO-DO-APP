# A Node JS To Do APP

This Web APP comes for people who need a little help organizing their routine, with it you can set all sorts of tasks, from grocery lists and daily chores to work projects and personal goals.

- **PostgreSQL**: 
  - A powerful relational database management system (RDBMS) that provides reliable data storage and management. PostgreSQL supports complex queries, transactions, and a variety of data types, making it ideal for handling user data and tasks efficiently.

- **Docker**: 
  - A platform that enables the creation and management of lightweight, portable containers. Docker ensures that each component of the application runs in an isolated environment, preventing dependency conflicts. This technology simplifies deployment and allows for consistent development across different environments.

- **Node.js**: 
  - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed for building scalable network applications. Node.js allows for asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations, making it perfect for handling multiple requests simultaneously. Its extensive ecosystem, accessible through npm (Node Package Manager), provides a wealth of libraries and frameworks to accelerate development.

These technologies work together to create a powerful foundation for the To-Do App, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient performance.
